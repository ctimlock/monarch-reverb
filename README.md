# An obsessive analysis of the Benson Monarch Reverb Amplifier

The circuit has been reverse-engineered from online photographs and best-guesswork where components can not be positively identified.
An LTSpice simulation has been created to demonstrate the functioning of the circuit under certain parameters, and the Hammond 370DX transformer has been added as a power source.

More investigation is required to exactly narrow down transformer specifications, etc.

Documentation and references coming soon.
